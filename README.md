## Portfolio Website

This website is dedicated to introducing my work on the Kaggle [Instacart Market Basket Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis) project and my research on tropical surfaces. The goal for this website is to share some of our code implementations in Python, and to look at these algorithms within the context of the research at hand.
