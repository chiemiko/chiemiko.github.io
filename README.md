## Research on Tropical Root Polytopes

This website is dedicated to introducing a few of the underlying concepts around tropical surfaces and my research work around the spectra of four types of these surfaces. The goal for this website is to share some of our code implementations in Python, and to look at these algorithms within the context of the research at hand.
